## ToDo App: Flask

Introductory example done in Flask following a [Python Engineer](https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/flask-todo-app/) tutorial, as a point of comparison to Svelte and other frameworks. 

Styled with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), which is potentially worthy of concept comparison to Boostrap, Tailwind, etc. in its own right.

Done as part of the first few assignments in COMPSCI 178: Engineering Usable Interactive Systems.
